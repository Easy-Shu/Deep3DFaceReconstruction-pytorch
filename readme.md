# Deep3DFaceReconstruction-pytorch

Pytorch version of the repo [Deep3DFaceReconstruction](https://github.com/microsoft/Deep3DFaceReconstruction). 

==The pytorch net model build script and the net model are also provided.==

Most of the numpy codes are also convert to pytorch codes.

**Support:**
1. Batch run
2. GPU


**How to use it**

1. See the text files in `BFM` and `network`, and get the necessary model files. It's better to run [Deep3DFaceReconstruction](https://github.com/microsoft/Deep3DFaceReconstruction) first.
2. Get the examples from Deep3DFaceReconstruction and create directories`input` and `output`.
3. Run `0.handle.py` to create my models in BFM. 
4. Run `1.th_demo`, the results will be in `output`.

You'd better see the scripts before running to avoid some trivial mistakes.
